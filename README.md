# Perspective API Tech Share - A lightweight API tool for content moderation 
_🔥Team Hot Takers for CSCI5117_

## Tech Share Description
In an ever growing digital world, content moderation is now more important than ever. Team Hot Takers introduces a content moderation tool, Perspective API, that we implemented in our project - "Hot Takes". Perspective offers a lightweight, easy-to-implement solution to content moderation by leveraging large language models coupled with human evaluation of comments to evaluate different moderation metrics of text-based content

## How the demo works 
To run this demo, you will require an API key provided by Perspective API. Details on how this can be obtained can be found here: https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-enable-the-api?language=en_US. You would need to provide this in the .env file and name it **PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY**. Once you clone the project, you would then install all dependencies using `pipenv install` or a suitable virtual environment configuration. Finally, you can run `python app.py` to launch the applicaiton locally on the http://127.0.0.1:5000 server. 

... And you're done! The demo website allows you to enter text manually and evaluate the metrics of the content by clicking the 'validate' button. Feel free to test out some random and classic movie/tv show quotes as well. Happy Moderating! 👀
